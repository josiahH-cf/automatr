# GAP Audit Verification Report

Date: 2025-09-11
Repo Base Commit: aa99846a590d321ee4507aa9523a5813dd5b4a96

Status: FIXED — Minimal edits applied to ensure full compliance with invariants and Phase 6 conclusions.

Edits Performed
- Added missing `## UNKNOWN Summary` section to ensure consistency across all documents:
  - `capsule/<feature_id>/assumptions.md` — appended UNKNOWN Summary stub.
  - `capsule/<feature_id>/CHANGELOG.md` — appended UNKNOWN Summary stub.
  - `capsule/<feature_id>/reports/manual_tests.md` — appended UNKNOWN Summary stub.
  - `capsule/<feature_id>/reports/chaos_results.md` — appended UNKNOWN Summary stub.

Validation Results
- Registry round-trip: PASS (`capsule/reports/validation/check_registry.py`).
- Header checks orchestration: PASS (`validate_all.sh` skips placeholder skeletons and exits 0).
- Identity handshake (headers + canonical URN schema_ref): PASS (applied across capsule markdown headers).
- Acceptance ↔ schema required coverage: WARN (expected at skeleton stage; `required` is empty).
- Concurrency tuple presence: WARN (sections exist with `<TBD>` placeholders, as expected at skeleton stage).

Notes
- No feature content was added; only structural stubs to satisfy invariant 4 (Follow-up Q rule).
