# Phase 4 Closeout Report

Path: capsule/reports/phase4_closeout.md

**Overview**
- Date: 2025-09-11
- Repo Base Commit: aa99846a590d321ee4507aa9523a5813dd5b4a96
- Purpose: Resolve remaining UNKNOWNs from Phase 4, update affected files and registry entries, re-run key validations, and confirm readiness for Phase 5 GAP audit.

**Resolution Log**
- Report doc_type standard
  - Questions asked:
    1) Prefer `quality.report.<name>` or `quality.<name>.report` naming? 2) Should report docs track their own schema major (v1) or inherit parent? 3) Should JSON report artifacts be represented in the registry?
  - Decision: Adopt `quality.report.<name>` with independent schema major (v1). Add entries for `manual_tests` and `chaos_results` only; JSON artifacts remain outside the prompt registry.
  - Changes: Updated registry and report headers accordingly.
- Metrics stack & units
  - Questions asked:
    1) What telemetry stack (e.g., OTel/Prometheus) and unit conventions are canonical? 2) Which SLI/SLO metrics are mandatory? 3) Are dashboards/alerts standardized across features?
  - Decision (temporary default): Keep a clearly marked TBD with Owner and due date; insert a placeholder metrics table structure. No feature-specific values added.
  - File updated: `capsule/<feature_id>/observability_slos.md`.
  - Default used: "Provide standard metrics taxonomy and unit conventions by 2025-09-25" (Owner: SRE/Platform Owner).
- Chaos tooling & schedule
  - Questions asked:
    1) Which chaos tooling is approved? 2) What cadence (weekly/monthly) and durations are standard? 3) Environment scope and safety guardrails?
  - Decision (temporary default): Keep a clearly marked TBD with Owner and due date; no specific tools or cadence encoded into the doc.
  - File updated: `capsule/<feature_id>/runtime_concurrency_tests.md`.
  - Default used: "Specify approved chaos tooling and schedule cadence by 2025-09-25" (Owner: QA/Resilience Owner).

**Validations Summary**
- Registry round-trip (every doc_type → file exists): PASS
- Header presence and order (all capsule markdown docs): PASS
- SemVer correctness (`version: 0.1.0` in all skeleton markdown): PASS
- Feature ID regex (`^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*(?:-v[0-9]+)?$`): WARN — skeletons intentionally use placeholder `<feature-id>`; enforcement applies at feature instantiation time.

**Updated Files**
- `prompts/registry.json` — added `quality.report.manual_tests` and `quality.report.chaos_results` mappings.
- `prompts/manual_test_report_template.md` — new template for `quality.report.manual_tests`.
- `prompts/chaos_results_report_template.md` — new template for `quality.report.chaos_results`.
- `capsule/<feature_id>/reports/manual_tests.md` — header doc_type set to `quality.report.manual_tests`.
- `capsule/<feature_id>/reports/chaos_results.md` — header doc_type set to `quality.report.chaos_results`.
- `capsule/<feature_id>/observability_slos.md` — added TBD note with Owner/due and placeholder metrics table.
- `capsule/<feature_id>/runtime_concurrency_tests.md` — added TBD note with Owner/due under Chaos and Soak Plan.
- `capsule/<feature_id>/assumptions.md` — fixed header order; added `doc_type: governance.assumptions`.

**Next Action**
- Phase 4 is finalized and ready for Phase 5 GAP audit. Proceed to create `capsule/reports/gap_audit.md`, run the audit checks against this scaffold (including registry consistency and header compliance), and document any residual gaps.
