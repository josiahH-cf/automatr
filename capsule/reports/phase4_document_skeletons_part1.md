# Phase 4 Document Skeletons — Part 1

Path: capsule/reports/phase4_document_skeletons_part1.md

**Overview**
- Date: 2025-09-11
- Repo Base Commit: aa99846a590d321ee4507aa9523a5813dd5b4a96
- Mission: Create seven empty, versioned document skeletons under `capsule/<feature_id>/` with required headers and minimal sections only. These act as executable contracts for future LLMs to populate; no feature content is included.

**Files Created**
| Path | doc_type |
| --- | --- |
| `capsule/<feature_id>/vision.md` | `planning.vision` |
| `capsule/<feature_id>/exploration.md` | `planning.exploration` |
| `capsule/<feature_id>/intent_card.md` | `planning.intent_card` |
| `capsule/<feature_id>/output_contract.schema.json` | `planning.output_contract` |
| `capsule/<feature_id>/action_budget.md` | `planning.action_budget` |
| `capsule/<feature_id>/concurrency_model.md` | `planning.concurrency_model` |
| `capsule/<feature_id>/sync_policies.md` | `planning.sync_policies` |

**Compliance Checks**
- Folder existence
  - `capsule/<feature_id>/` exists — PASS
  - `capsule/<feature_id>/reports/` exists — PASS (placeholder `.keep` added)
- Markdown headers (all *.md)
  - First six headers present in exact order — PASS
    - `feature_id`, `owner`, `doc_type`, `schema_ref`, `version`, `updated`
  - Header values use placeholders only (no content) — PASS
- Section presence (exact per file)
  - `vision.md`: Overview; Success Criteria; Non-Goals; UNKNOWN Summary — PASS
  - `exploration.md`: In Scope; Out of Scope; Assumptions; Dependencies and Interfaces; Risks and Unknowns; Concurrency Context; UNKNOWN Summary — PASS
  - `intent_card.md`: Objective; End-State Bullets; Non-Goals; Acceptance Checklist; Concurrency Targets; UNKNOWN Summary — PASS
    - Includes a placeholder table under Acceptance Checklist mapping items → future `schema.required` fields — PRESENT
  - `action_budget.md`: Editable vs Read-only; Whitelist (dry-run first); Denylist; Pre-checks; Side-effect Boundaries; UNKNOWN Summary — PASS
  - `concurrency_model.md`: Model Overview; Isolation Rules; Ordering and Delivery Semantics; Cancellation and Timeout; Retry Budgets and Redelivery; UNKNOWN Summary — PASS
  - `sync_policies.md`: Synchronization Primitives; Backpressure Policy; Resource Quotas and Fairness; Scheduling Rules; UNKNOWN Summary — PASS
- JSON validity
  - `output_contract.schema.json` parses — PASS
  - Required keys present exactly as specified — PASS
- Size-guideline notes (~800 tokens when filled)
  - `exploration.md` may exceed if scope/risks are extensive; consider splitting by domain if needed.
  - `concurrency_model.md` and `sync_policies.md` can approach the limit for complex systems; consider annexes for lengthy examples.

**UNKNOWN Summary**
| Field | Context | Owner | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Concurrency Targets in `intent_card.md` | Whether concurrency targets are in scope for this feature capsule is unspecified. | Product/Architecture Leads | Confirm scope; if out, leave section stub and record rationale. |
| `validation_path` in output_contract | Default path set to `capsule/<feature_id>/reports/validation.json`; confirm if another location is required. | Platform/Tooling Owner | Approve default or provide alternate path contract. |
| `permitted_mutations` policy | Allowed mutation modes are placeholder. Repository-wide policy is not documented. | Architecture/Platform Owner | Define allowed set and update schema accordingly. |

**Next Action**
- Part 2: Create the remaining skeletons (`reference_set.md`, `evaluation_and_tripwires.md`, `observability_slos.md`, `manual_tests.md`, `runtime_concurrency_tests.md`, `meta_prompts.md`, `phase_transition.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` for `governance.changelog`), applying the same header order, placeholder-only sections, and validation checks.
