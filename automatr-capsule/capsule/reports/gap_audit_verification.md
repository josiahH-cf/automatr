# GAP Audit Verification
Date: 2025-09-12
Repo Base Commit: 6a83cb3101057310153e768fa90833ebbd571156

## Checks & Outcomes
- Repository & Structure: PASS — `/prompts`, `/features`, legacy `/capsule`, and `capsule/reports/validation/` present; controller/validators wired.
- Templates & Registry: PASS — `prompts/registry.json` covers all required planning.*, governance.*, quality.*; round‑trip check OK.
- Controller & Workflow: PASS — Controller and launcher support both roots, run validation after each doc, and document final implementable gate.
- Unknowns Handling: PASS — Templates include standardized UNKNOWN Summary; unknowns listed and policy enforced; unresolved items flow to assumptions.
- Versioning & Identity: PASS — Canonical header spec enforced; schema evolution helper present; SemVer rules documented.
- Manual Tests Sync: PASS — Template derives tests from `schema.required` and acceptance; validator enforces coverage and schema version reference.
- Validation Pipeline: WARN (expected for placeholders) — `validate_all.sh` reports Gate WARN only due to skeleton placeholders (empty required[], missing tuple values). No failures.
- Regression/Legacy Safety: PASS — Legacy `/capsule/**` untouched; controller and validators support both roots; no regressions.

## Fixes Applied
None — no changes required.

## Outstanding Unknowns
None — no blocking questions. Placeholder WARNs will be resolved by the first real feature capsule (populate `required[]` and concurrency tuple values).

## Next Steps
None — system ready for feature capsule creation.
