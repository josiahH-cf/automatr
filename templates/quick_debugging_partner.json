  "description": "This template diagnoses bugs and proposes minimal fixes to help you resolve issues quickly without over-engineering. It ranks likely root causes by probability, maps to failure patterns, and recommends the smallest safe change with validation steps. Output: 2-4 ranked hypotheses with confidence percentages, minimal fix plan with file paths/commands, and validation checklist. Use when encountering errors, failing tests, or unexpected behavior requiring rapid diagnosis.",
