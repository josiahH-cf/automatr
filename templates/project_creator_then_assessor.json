Question rounds \u2014 Output Round 1\u20133 with exactly three questions each; capture answers or assumptions.\n2. Discovery synthesis \u2014 Summarize goals, constraints, stakeholders, resources, dependencies, unknowns.\n3. Project structuring \u2014 Define workstreams, milestones, deliverables, owners/roles, dependencies, timelines.\n4. Execution backlog \u2014 Tasks per milestone with acceptance criteria, estimates, and measurement hooks.\n5. Risk & mitigation \u2014 Strategic/operational/delivery risks with impact, likelihood, mitigations, triggers.\n6. Assessment \u2014 Evaluate alignment, resources, sequencing, readiness; flag unresolved decisions.\n7. Monitoring setup \u2014 KPIs, review cadence, tooling, escalation paths.\n\n## Execution Flow\n1) Rounds 1\u20133 questions\n2) Synthesis\n3) Blueprint\n4) Backlog\n5) Risks\n6) Assessment\n7) Monitoring\n\n## Output Format\n1. Question Rounds \u2014 Sections for Round 1\u20133 with exactly three numbered questions each (note assumptions).\n2. Discovery Synthesis \u2014 Bulleted summary of confirmed facts, assumptions, and open items.\n3. Project Blueprint \u2014 Table: Workstream | Milestone | Deliverables | Owner/Role | Due date (estimate) | Dependencies | Acceptance criteria.\n4. Execution Backlog \u2014 Ordered list grouped by milestone with tasks, effort/duration, success measures, owners/TBD.\n5. Risk Register \u2014 Table: Risk | Category | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit.\n6. Assessment & Recommendations \u2014 Narrative plus go/no-go checklist with prerequisites.\n7. Monitoring Plan \u2014 Bullets for KPIs, instrumentation, review cadence, escalation paths.\n\n## Quality Checks\n- Exactly three questions per round.\n- Synthesis includes confirmed data and gaps.\n- Blueprint covers scope, owners, dependencies, timelines, acceptance criteria.\n- Risks include owners/triggers; cover strategic and execution layers.\n- Assessment states readiness and blockers.\n\n## Eval Stubs\n- pass_if(rounds == 3 && questions_per_round == 3)\n- pass_if(has_blueprint_table == true)\n- pass_if(has_risk_register == true)\n\n## Self-Check\nIf any Quality Check would fail, revise once before returning.",
  "description": "This template transforms high-level goals into fully scoped project blueprints with risk assessment to help you plan complex initiatives systematically. It runs 3 rounds of clarifying questions, structures workstreams/milestones/deliverables, and stress-tests the plan before sign-off. Output: project blueprint with tasks, risk matrix, KPIs, and readiness assessment. Use when starting new projects, scoping initiatives, or converting ideas into actionable plans with resource allocation.",
