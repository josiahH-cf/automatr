  "description": "This template converts meeting notes or documents into actionable task lists to help you extract commitments and organize next steps. It identifies decisions, extracts tasks with owners/deadlines, and flags ambiguities or missing information. Output: 4-6 bullet summary, task table (Task/Owner/Due/Status/Context), decisions with rationale, and open questions. Use after meetings, when processing notes, or converting text into structured action items.",
