  "description": "This template transforms unstructured notes into organized summaries to help you make sense of messy thoughts and extract actionable items. It detects themes, clusters related ideas, extracts insights, and derives action items with owners/priority/timeline. Output: structured themes with nested bullets, action items table, insights/reflections, and parking lot with revisit triggers. Use after brainstorming sessions, meeting notes, or when processing scattered ideas into coherent plans.",
