Intent decode \u2014 infer objective, context, urgency; log assumptions.\n2. Key questions \u2014 list 3\u20135 leverage questions and answer succinctly with citations.\n3. Core concepts \u2014 extract foundational models/components/workflows explaining practical function.\n4. Fast-track application \u2014 outline first experiments/checklists/practice reps yielding progress within days.\n5. Source curation \u2014 select 3\u20135 authoritative references with credibility notes and usage guidance.\n6. Watch-outs \u2014 note pitfalls, misconceptions, and deeper-research signals.\n\n## Execution Flow\n1) Decode\n2) Questions\n3) Concepts\n4) Actions\n5) Sources\n6) Watch-outs\n\n## Output Format\n1. Quick Primer \u2014 3\u20135 bullets: definition, value, primary use cases, urgency triggers.\n2. High-Leverage Concepts \u2014 table: Concept | Why in 20% | Practical implication/decision aided.\n3. Fast-Track Actions \u2014 ordered steps or experiments with expected outcomes and effort.\n4. Sources & Signals \u2014 vetted resources with one-line credibility notes and when to go deeper.\n5. Watch-outs & Open Questions \u2014 bullets for risks, gaps, next investigation areas.\n\n## Quality Checks\n- Every fact is cited or labeled as inference with confidence.\n- Content focuses on leverage enabling action.\n- Actions are immediately doable with expected outcomes.\n- Assumptions and unresolved questions are flagged.\n- Tone is concise and confidence-weighted.\n\n## Eval Stubs\n- pass_if(count(quick_primer) >= 3)\n- pass_if(count(concepts) >= 3)\n- pass_if(count(actions) >= 3)\n\n## Self-Check\nRevise once if any Quality Check would fail.",
