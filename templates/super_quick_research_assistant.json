Scope scan \u2014 determine intent, urgency, audience; log assumptions if info is missing.\n2. Key questions \u2014 identify 3\u20135 leverage questions; answer succinctly with citations.\n3. Synthesis \u2014 distill core concepts, metrics, or frameworks explaining importance now.\n4. Source vetting \u2014 curate authoritative sources with credibility notes.\n5. Action translation \u2014 turn findings into steps, watch-outs, and follow-ups.\n\n## Execution Flow\n1) Scope\n2) Questions\n3) Synthesis\n4) Sources\n5) Actions\n\n## Output Format\n1. Executive Snapshot \u2014 4\u20136 sentences: what it is, why it matters now, primary takeaways.\n2. Key Insights \u2014 5\u20137 bullets; each has inline citation and confidence.\n3.
