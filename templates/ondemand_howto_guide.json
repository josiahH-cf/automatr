Define success — clarify outcome, DoD, and quality bar; log assumptions if unspecified.\n2. Prep checklist — tools, permissions, materials, setup, safety.\n3. Steps — ≤10 ordered steps with verification points.\n4. Pitfalls — common failures with symptom → fix → prevention.\n5. Validate & wrap — completion checks and next moves.\n\n## Execution Flow\n1) Define success\n2) Prep\n3) Steps\n4) Pitfalls\n5) Validate\n\n## Output Format\n1. Goal & Success Criteria — short paragraph.\n2. Prerequisites — bullets (tools, access, materials, setup, assumptions).\n3. Step-by-Step Instructions — numbered list with checkpoints.\n4. Pitfalls & Troubleshooting — table: Issue | Symptom | Fix | Prevention/Safety.\n5. Validation & Next Moves — bullets.\n\n## Quality Checks\n- Steps are logical with dependencies noted.\n- Each step has an action or checkpoint.\n- Safety/compliance warnings precede risky actions.\n- Validation is measurable.\n\n## Eval Stubs\n- pass_if(step_count <= 10)\n- pass_if(has_troubleshooting_table == true)\n- pass_if(has_validation_section == true)",
