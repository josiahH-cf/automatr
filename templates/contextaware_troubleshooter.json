Situation summary\n2. Known vs Unknown matrix\n3. Hypotheses with evidence\n4. Diagnostics plan\n5. Action plan with priorities\n6. Prevention & resilience\n\n## Output Format\n1.

Hypotheses & Tests \u2014 Table: Hypothesis | Evidence | Diagnostic step | Proposed fix | Confidence.\n4.

Outstanding Questions \u2014 Items to confirm or supply.\n\n## Quality Checks\n- At most one clarifying question; assumptions logged.\n- Known vs Unknown structured and complete.\n- Hypotheses map to decisive diagnostics and fixes.\n- Action plan prioritized with clear outcomes and owners/TBD.\n- Prevention guidance is actionable and tied to causes.\n\n## Eval Stubs\n- pass_if(clarifying_questions_used <= 1)\n- pass_if(has_known_unknowns == true)\n- pass_if(has_p0_tasks == true)\n\n## Self-Check\nIf any Quality Check would fail, revise once before returning.",
  "description": "This template fixes bugs and generates comprehensive test coverage to help you prevent regression while resolving issues. It diagnoses the bug, implements the fix, and creates edge case tests (including negative cases). Output: bug fix code, new test suite with \u22653 test cases, and validation that tests fail pre-fix and pass post-fix. Use when bug fixing should include test hardening to prevent similar issues.",
