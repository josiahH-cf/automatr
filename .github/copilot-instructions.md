# Copilot Instructions

## Core Principle
Do the simplest thing that could work. Never over-engineer.

## When Adding Features
1. Understand the existing code first
2. Make the smallest change that achieves the goal
3. Reuse existing patterns and utilities
4. Add new code near related code
5. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## When Planning
- Break work into small, concrete steps
- Each step should be independently testable
- If a plan feels complex, simplify it
- Ask: "What's the minimal change needed?"

## Code Style
- Match the existing project style
- Keep functions short and focused
- Use clear, descriptive names
- No unnecessary abstractions

## What to Avoid
- Creating new files when editing existing ones works
- Adding layers of abstraction "for flexibility"
- Solving problems that don't exist yet
- Complex patterns when simple ones work
